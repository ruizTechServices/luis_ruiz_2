# Agent Session Log
**Session:** 2026-01-21 09:30 PM EST
**Project:** new_main_4
**Stack:** Next.js 15 (App Router) + TypeScript

## Previously on this project:
The project includes a Nucleus API surface for auth, credits, packages, and LLM proxying. Current production build fails due to missing exports in `lib/nucleus/pricing.ts` and a TypeScript type error in the Nucleus LLM chat route.

## Session Objective:
Fix `npm run build` by restoring missing pricing exports and resolving the TypeScript role comparison error.

## Plan:
- Create/maintain session log.
- Restore missing pricing exports (`getAllModelPricing`, `getCreditPackages`, `getSubscriptionPlans`) with DB-first + fallback behavior.
- Fix TypeScript message typing in `app/api/nucleus/llm/chat/route.ts`.
- Re-run `npm run build` to verify.

## Iterations:
