Gio, Ada here. I reviewed your Supabase project (id: huyhgdsjpdjzokjwaspb) in schemas auth and public. Below is a concise map plus recommendations. If this isn’t the correct project, let me know and I’ll re-check.

Findings

auth schema
users (RLS on). 2 rows. Standard Supabase auth table.
identities, sessions, refresh_tokens, audit_log_entries, one_time_tokens, schema_migrations, instances, oauth_clients, etc. All standard. RLS enabled on core auth tables.
public schema
site_settings (RLS on). Columns: id (PK), availability (bool, default true), availability_text (default 'Available for hire'), updated_at.
user_profiles (RLS on). FKey user_id → auth.users.id. Unique username. Good for profile data.
blog_posts (inferred). Referenced by comments/votes as a FK target.
comments (RLS off). FKey post_id → blog_posts.id. Columns include id (bigint), post_id, user_email, content, created_at.
votes (RLS off). FKey post_id → blog_posts.id. Columns include vote_type with CHECK in {up, down}.
todos (RLS off). Simple todo table, 54 rows.
catalog (RLS off). Simple product-like table; Price is float (real).
responses (RLS off). FKey user_id → auth.users.id.
conversations (RLS off). Composite PK (conversation_id uuid, position_id int). role CHECK {user, assistant}. 32 rows.
chat_counter (RLS off). last_chat_id integer counter. 1 row.
chat_messages (RLS off). id (bigint identity), chat_id (int4), message (text), created_at, embedding (vector, nullable). 10 rows.
chat_embeddings (RLS off). id (int), chat_id (bigint) → chat_messages.id, role, message, embedding (vector), created_at. 0 rows.
extensions
vector 0.6.0 installed (for embeddings). Many others available (postgis, pg_graphql, pgcrypto, etc.).
What looks good

chat_embeddings.chat_id is bigint referencing chat_messages.id — consistent with your previous migration (bigint FK).
RLS is active for auth tables and for public.user_profiles and public.site_settings.
conversations table uses a composite PK that fits an append-only chat log.
votes has a CHECK to constrain allowed values.
Potential issues and cleanups

RLS gaps on public tables:
comments, votes, chat_messages, chat_embeddings, conversations, todos, responses, catalog have RLS disabled.
If these endpoints are exposed publicly or you rely on client access, I recommend enabling RLS and adding explicit policies per use case (read-only for anonymous, write for authenticated, etc.).
chat schema consistency:
chat_messages.id is bigint, but chat_messages.chat_id is int4 while chat_embeddings.chat_id is bigint referencing chat_messages.id. Consider normalizing types:
Option A: treat chat_messages.id as the single “message id” and drop chat_messages.chat_id if not needed.
Option B: if chat_id is a conversation/thread id, migrate it to bigint and add a proper FK to a conversations table (or to chat_counter if that’s intended). Right now there’s no FK constraint on chat_messages.chat_id.
duplicated embedding storage:
chat_messages has an embedding vector column and chat_embeddings also stores embeddings. If you only need one embeddings table, consider consolidating to a single place (I suggest keeping chat_embeddings as the embedding store and removing the embedding column from chat_messages) to avoid drift.
indexing for performance:
comments: index on post_id (e.g., CREATE INDEX comments_post_id_idx ON public.comments(post_id)).
votes: index on post_id; consider unique constraint to prevent duplicate votes by the same user/email per post (e.g., UNIQUE(post_id, user_email)).
chat_embeddings: add a vector index (HNSW or IVFFlat) on embedding with the correct dimension (e.g., CREATE INDEX … USING hnsw (embedding vector_l2_ops)). Ensure the dimension matches your embedding model.
chat_messages: index on created_at if you page by time; index on chat_id if you query by conversation/thread.
money/price type:
catalog.Price is real (float). For pricing, prefer numeric(12,2) to avoid floating point rounding issues.
vector dimension:
The vector column dimension isn’t shown here. If you plan to use nomic-embed-text:latest via Ollama, verify the output dimension and set the vector column accordingly (e.g., vector(768)). Mismatched dimensions will error on insert.
How this ties to your new Ollama UI

You can persist chat messages sent from 
app/ollama/page.tsx
 into public.chat_messages and store embeddings into public.chat_embeddings using the new POST /api/ollama/embeddings endpoint.
If you want per-conversation threads, we should:
Normalize chat_messages.chat_id to reference a real conversation row, or add a proper conversations table FK, and migrate the type to bigint for consistency.
Introduce RLS so only the owner (auth.uid()) can read/write their own conversations.
Questions to confirm before I generate migrations

Do you want me to enable RLS and write safe policies for:
comments, votes, chat_messages, chat_embeddings, conversations, todos, responses, catalog?
Should we:
Remove the embedding column from chat_messages and use chat_embeddings exclusively?
Normalize chat_messages.chat_id to a proper FK and align it to bigint?
Add the recommended indexes (comments.post_id, votes.post_id, unique (post_id, user_email), chat_embeddings HNSW/IVFFlat)?
Change catalog.Price from real to numeric(12,2)?
What embedding model will you standardize on for Ollama? I’ll set the correct vector dimension.
If you confirm, I’ll draft the precise SQL migrations (via Supabase MCP) and policy definitions to apply cleanly in this project.
